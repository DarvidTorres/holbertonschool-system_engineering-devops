To design a scalable and resilient web infrastructure for hosting a website like www.foobar.com, you can distribute different components across multiple servers and use a load balancer to manage traffic. Here's a breakdown of the infrastructure components and the rationale for including each:

1. **Server**:
   - **Purpose**: To host the different components of the web infrastructure. Each server is dedicated to a specific role, enhancing performance and security.
   - **Specifics**: In this setup, you will have multiple servers, each dedicated to hosting one component - one for the web server, one for the application server, and one for the database.

2. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**:
   - **Purpose**: To distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring efficient load handling and improved availability.
   - **Configuration as a Cluster**: Configuring HAproxy as part of a cluster enhances its reliability. If one HAproxy instance fails, the other can take over, ensuring continuous availability.
   - **Specifics**: The load balancer can distribute traffic between different servers hosting the web and application servers. This setup is crucial for handling high traffic efficiently and providing failover mechanisms.

3. **Split Components**:
   - **Web Server**: Hosts the static content and handles HTTP requests. Separating it onto its own server allows for optimized configuration and security specific to web serving needs.
   - **Application Server**: Runs the application code (business logic). Isolating the application server enables dedicated resource allocation, thereby improving performance and making the system more secure.
   - **Database Server**: Manages data storage and retrieval. A dedicated database server ensures data integrity and performance, especially under high load conditions.

By adding each of these elements, the infrastructure achieves several key objectives:

- **Scalability**: With separate servers for each component, itâ€™s easier to scale up any part of the system independently as demand grows.
- **Performance**: Dedicated resources for each component mean that there's less competition for resources, leading to better performance.
- **Security**: Isolating different components reduces the risk of a security breach affecting the entire system.
- **Availability**: Using a load balancer, especially in a clustered setup, improves the availability of the website. If one server goes down, the load balancer can redirect traffic to the remaining operational servers.

This infrastructure design is ideal for medium to large-scale web applications, where traffic load, security, and performance are significant considerations.
